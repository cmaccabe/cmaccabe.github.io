### Projects
GPS Athlete Data (SQL, Excel and Tableau):
I was interested in grabbing relevant metrics based on date and invidiual performances, then ranking those metrics to visually see who the outliers were. I was able to represent this both in excel and SQL using my knowledge of both programs, then show this in a different visual representation through Tableau.
- Excel Cleaning, formatting and Visualization
- Tableau Visualzation: Indiv differences, dates, highest vs avg numbers
- Visualization: [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/collin.maccabe/viz/GPSPractice/Dashboard1)

SuperStore Performance (SQL, Excel and Tableau):
I pulled this dataset from Kaggle to see if I could make some easily understandable visualizations. I enjoyed providing a more numeric representation through excel and then providing the graphs through Tableau.
- I worked on the information provided in excel to break the store performance up by sales per region, category, payment method and ship method
- I wanted to showcase some of the formulas I know in excel to create an easy to read, dynamic "breakdown"
- In SQL, I broke the performance metrics up similarly to what I did in excel. My goal was to see if I could both recreate that information, as well as investigate it into further breakdown
- I was able to gather average sales and total sales per category and region in different ways to understand the information more thoroughly
- Through Tableau Public I feel I was able to compare total sales to profit for each month and present the sales per region.

Ecommerce Performance (SQL & Excel)
- I investigated a data set to determine who consumers were (gender & age), what payment method they used, and if they were purchasing add-ons for their orders
- Through this investigation I was able to determine most customers were men and were more likely to complete orders BUT women purchased more add-ons and had higher revenue from add-ons
- The median age for orders was 49 years old, Bank transfer was the greatest form of payment used and standard shipping was the greatest shipping method used
- 76% of people who made an online purchase also purchased some form of add-on
